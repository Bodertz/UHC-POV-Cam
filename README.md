# UHC-POV-Cam

A port of [https://github.com/madman-bob/Homestuck-POV-Cam](madman-bob's Homestuck POV Cam Chrome extension to the UHC.

**This mod will unfortunately bug out with multiple tabs, only the furthest right tab will display the correct timeline links**

This mod is unfinished, as you can probably tell by the version.

TODO:
- Fix tab bug
- Enable hover text
- Remove the need for a full reload when changing options
