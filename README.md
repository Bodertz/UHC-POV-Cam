# UHC-POV-Cam

A port of [madman-bob](https://github.com/madman-bob/Homestuck-POV-Cam)'s Homestuck POV Cam Chrome extension to the UHC.

~~This mod will unfortunately bug out with multiple tabs, only the furthest right tab will display the correct timeline links~~ This issue has been fixed.

This mod is unfinished, as you can probably tell by the version.

TODO:
- Enable hover text
- Remove the need for a full reload when changing options
- Resolve missing pages

### v0.2

- Accounted for missing page indexes within timelines.json
- Revised john.png with john2.png
- Fixed tab bug
